We have a webpage that displays publications.
Each publication has the following properties:
publication-id
publication-media
publication-details
publication-title-hebrew
publication-title-english
publication-link
publication-hashtags-hebrew
publication-hashtags-english
publication-author
publication-platform
publication-year-jewish
publication-year-civil

Recommend an architecture to refactor the current webpage such that wel will have a database containing those publications and the webpage will show them.

In case the webpage is hosted on github pages which enable static pages what is your recommendation?
